# Repository for Business Analytics Project

We recommend using a separate [`virtualenv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to install required packages.
You can also create a new `virtualenv` within IDE like PyCharm. After activation of your `virtualenv`, 
you can install required packages by running the following code in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/10258392511/BusinessAnalyticsProject.git
cd BusinessAnalyticsProject
pip install -e .
```
To test whether you have a successful installation, please run `test_install.py` either in your IDE or running the 
following code
```bash
python test_install.py
```
You should see `Successfully installed major packages!` printed in tour terminal.
